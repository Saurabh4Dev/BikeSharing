## General Information


Problem Statement
BoomBikes allows individuals to borrow bikes on a short-term basis. Recently, BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has faced significant revenue declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic and seeks to develop a business plan to recover post-lockdown.

To prepare for a potential increase in demand for shared bikes as the situation improves, BoomBikes is working with a consulting firm to identify the key factors affecting bike demand. They aim to determine which variables significantly predict bike usage and how well these variables describe demand patterns.

Business Goal:

Model the demand for shared bikes using available independent variables to help management adjust strategies and meet customer expectations effectively.
The model will also aid in understanding demand dynamics for future growth.




## Technologies Used
Python 3.10.4
jupyter notebook

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->

## conclusions
Developed a model to find the variables significant to the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. Details of conclusions found in code file.
